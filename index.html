      <h1>Audio Worklets & Processors</h1>
      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <p>
        Experimenting with AudioWorklets and Processors to try and improve the
        implementation of the WebAudio API used for the purpose of creating
        computer music.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, we have experienced good initial sound results in the Firefox
        browser, in terms of sound quality, however, the quality slowly and
        surely turns to crap as the playing duration increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to recover from the 'crap' is to force a complete refresh
        of the web page via the function key <i>F5</i>, which is completely
        unacceptable me thinks. I mean, imagine this:- 'fishbite concerto in D
        minor' <b>Showcasing:</b> <i>Snap, Crackle & Flippin Pop</i> with guest
        appearances: <i>Delays & DropOuts</i>.
